# About
The motivation behind <b>taxDeductor</b> was to provide a programming exercise; where I could develop my programming skills and get familiar with source control using Git Hub. The 1x version of the program was produced, with a view to developing a GUI version of the program using Windows Forms or WPF in C# at a later stage.

taxDeductor is setup with constants, which have been hard coded from information on tax and National Insurance (NI) rate information, taken from:

https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/current-rates-and-allowances and

https://www.gov.uk/self-employed-national-insurance-rates

taxDeductor is designed for self employed workers within the UK, and will use the above information and user imputed values to calculate how much tax and NI contributions the user can expect to pay for the year.

Version 1.1.3 - 30th June 2017.

# Important information

This program currently calculates a users National Insurance (NI) contributions due for the year based on Class 2 and Class 4 contributions; however,  please bear in mind that; "The [UK] government has announced Class 2 NICs will be abolished from April 2018."
